## 🤖 Automated Riddle Request (Issue)

This issue was created by the interactive game UI requesting that the Riddle Finder Agent be used in a new riddle via a code-agent PR.

Please run the Riddle Finder Agent to find or generate a high-quality riddle, add the riddle file to `system/riddles/`, update `system/riddles/riddles.js`, and open a PR for review.

Notes / preferences (Copilot needs to choose one of these and ensure the riddles complexity matches):
- Source type (philosophical / logic / wordplay / technical):
- Difficulty (medium / hard / expert):

Agent needs to ensure the **Notes** section in `.github/agents/riddle-finder.agent.md` to ensure the generated riddle meets quality standards.

*Generated by the game UI.*
