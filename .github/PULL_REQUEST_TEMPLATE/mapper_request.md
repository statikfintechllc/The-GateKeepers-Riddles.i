## 🗺️ Automated Repository Mapping Request

This pull request was generated for repository mapping. The Repo Mapper Agent (or a maintainer) should:

2. Update the SQLite database with comprehensive metadata.
3. Generate mapping artifacts (repo-map.json, code-index.json, ARCHITECTURE.md).
4. Update the corresponding PR.
5. Open and Merge after mapping is complete.

**Expected timing:** Please allow ~5-10 minutes for automation to complete and database updates.
